# Email+
Email+ is a way to define reusable templates and components to be used in the OOB email notifications in ServiceNow. By putting everything in to a reusable template, the cost of maintenance will go down and the ease to change small things in a header across the company will rise.

Further more, Email+ also has:

* A feature to incorporate an email tracking pixel in to the email body, to track if an email has been opened.
* A feature to wrap the links in an email with a trackable link, so you can track the click rate of an email.
